# Wildfire Emission Forecasting

This project aims to use advanced machine learning techniques to predict and analyze wildfire emissions using historical data. Whether you're a researcher, a policymaker, or simply curious about how technology can help us understand and manage wildfires, this project provides a fascinating insight into wildfire emission forecasting.

## Project Overview

### What is Wildfire Emission Forecasting?

Wildfire emission forecasting involves predicting the release of pollutants and other emissions from wildfires. This information is crucial for understanding the environmental impact of wildfires, managing air quality, and planning emergency responses. Historical data and machine learning models provide powerful tools for forecasting wildfire emissions accurately.

### Project Goals

1. **Predict Wildfire Emissions**: Use historical data to predict emissions from wildfires.
2. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
3. **Visualize Emissions**: Create visual representations of wildfire emissions for easy understanding and analysis.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Data Preparation

We start by gathering and preparing the necessary data. This involves:

- **Collecting Historical Data**: High-resolution historical data on wildfires and related factors.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting the data for analysis.

### Step 2: Model Training

Using advanced machine learning techniques, we train a model to predict wildfire emissions. The model learns to recognize patterns in the historical data that indicate the presence and intensity of wildfires.

### Step 3: Wildfire Emission Prediction

Once the model is trained, it can predict emissions on new data. This helps in real-time monitoring and forecasting of wildfire emissions.

### Step 4: Model Evaluation

To ensure our predictions are accurate, we evaluate the model using various metrics. This step is crucial for understanding the reliability of our predictions and making necessary improvements.

### Step 5: Visualization

Finally, we create visual representations of the wildfire emission predictions. These visuals make it easy to see the distribution and intensity of wildfire emissions.

## Key Features

## Getting Started: Using the Workflow

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download the Source Code**

   - Visit the release page of the `GMU-SESS-AQ/firecasting` repository:[GMU-SESS-AQ firecasting Releases](https://github.com/GMU-SESS-AQ/firecasting/releases)
   - Select the latest release available and download the corresponding zip file of the source code.

2. **Import the Workflow into Your Environment**

   - Open Geoweaver running on your local machine. [video guidance](https://youtu.be/jUd1dzi18EQ)
   - Click on "Weaver" in the top navigation bar.
   - A workspace to add a workflow opens up. Select the "Import" icon in the top navigation bar.
   - Choose the downloaded zip file. Click on "Start" to upload the file. If the file is valid, a prompt will ask for your permission to upload. Click "OK".
   - Once the file is uploaded, Geoweaver will create a new workflow named `firecast_main`.

3. **Execute the Workflow**

   - Click on the execute icon in the top navigation bar to start the workflow execution process. [video guidance](https://youtu.be/PJcMNR00QoE)
   - A wizard will open where you need to select the host [video guidance](https://youtu.be/KYiEHI0rn_o) and environment [video guidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H66AVoBBaHs).
   - Click on "Execute" icon to initiate the workflow. Enter the required password when prompted and click "Confirm" to start executing the workflow.

4. **Monitor Execution and View Results**

   - The workflow execution will begin.
   - Green indicates the process is successful, Yellow indicates the process is running, and Red indicates the process has failed.
   - Once the execution is complete, the results will be available immediately.

By following these steps, you will be able to set up and execute the wildfire emission forecasting workflow.
