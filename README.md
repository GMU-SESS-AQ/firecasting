# firecasting
This is our workflow for wildfire emission forecasting.

# Usage

This is directly exported from Geweaver instance running in GMU hopper. You can better view them by downloading the latest Released zip file in the Release page. 

Install and open Geoweaver in your web browser.

Go to the Weaver tab and click `upload` button in the toolbar.

Selected the download firecasting zip file and open.

You will see a workflow showing up in the Weaver workspace in Geoweaver. All the source code and history runs we have done in Hopper are all there. 

If you want to replicate/reproduce the workflow, please find a Linux-like environment with the dataset ready. For questions regarding execution environment and datsets, please post on the Issues or directly contact us. :)
